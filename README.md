Development:
For this project we were required to build an online daily puzzle, operating similar to Wordle.
The app is a short daily exercise that users do; the users recieve a score, or some kind of feedback; they can share their performance with others through social media or similar mechanisms; and they can track their progress and statistics. It is convenient and easy to play via mobile devices, and engaging enough for the users to want to return regulerly.

Design:
Largley ispired by wordle, it has a simlary layout and scheme that is both easy to use but complex enough to have all the options needed to run effeciently.
